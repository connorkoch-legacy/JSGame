# JSGame

Our project is worth 100 points because we took a beloved game and rebuilt it bottom-up. Some CSS3 features that we have included are keyframe animations, fade-ins,
and textbox popups. The most difficult part of writing this game was initially using a canvas, and realizing that there is a lot of extra stuff involved with drawing
manually, a lot of weird edge cases such as windows resizing. All of this was made easier when we decided to use a div of other divs instead.
